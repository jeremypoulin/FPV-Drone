## Notice of Safety

I am not responsible for any harm or damges that resultr from use of this repositoryu.

Multiple safety elements have been included in this design:

- Smoke Stopper Battery Connection:
    Upon first connection of a battery, a smoke stopper is place between the drone lead and battery lead to mitigate the possibility of fire/explosion.
- Disarm Switch programmed through Betaflight:
    A flick of designated switch on any radio controllerler will stop the motors instant.
- Multimeter testing:
    Thorough continuity testing was done to ensure the absence of short circuits and breaks.
- Soldering Safety:
    An N95 Mask was worn during indoor soldering
